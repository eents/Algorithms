# :cloudy: Fisher Yates Shuffle Assignment :cloudy:

#### Fisher-Yates shuffle is an algorithm for shuffling the elements of an array where every possible outcome is capable of occuring. My application was made after following Parts 1 and 2 of the tutorial on Canvas. It is a pretty straightforward algorithm, I didn't have any trouble understanding what it does or how it works!
