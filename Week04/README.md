## :rainbow: Algorithms Free Choice Project! :rainbow:

/10-13 Update!/
I have specific goals for this project now..

-Include useful comments throughout the code so myself or somebody else can easily understand what is happening where
-Change the colors of the shapes and the background depending on the month on the user's local machine
-Change how fast the diamond rotates depending on the time on the user's local machine
-Stretch goal is adding a hidden sphere inside the diamond that is only visible at a certain hour and minute of the day.

For my free choice algorithm project, I decided I want to get learn more JavaScript. My initial idea is a 3D object that changes color/texture based on the time of day on the user’s local machine. Maybe it’s rotation speed, background color, and other elements could also change based on additional factors like clicks, location data, etc!
