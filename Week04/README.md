#### This project went a lot of places! The link for the project is above, and notes from each week of iterations are below..

### 10/6 : For my free choice algorithm project, I decided I want to get learn more JavaScript. My initial idea is a 3D object that changes color/texture based on the time of day on the user’s local machine. Maybe it’s rotation speed, background color, and other elements could also change based on additional factors like clicks, location data, etc!

### 10/13 This week I brainstormed specific, actionable goals for this project.. Include useful comments for my future self and others. Change the color palette of the shape, the background color, and the speed that the shape rotates depending on info from the user's local machine like the date and time. A stretch goal is adding a hidden sphere inside the shape that is only visible at a certain hour and minute of the day.

### 10/20 This week I was able to change the rotation speed of the shape based on the hour of the day. I was also able to change the background color of the page based on the day of the month.

### 10/27 This week I was able to change the color palette of the shape based on the minute of the day. I started working towards the stretch goal of there being a hidden sphere exposed at 11:11, but I wasn't able to get it working fully. It's clear that there are some fundamental bugs with the way the shape is drawn and colored. Woof.

### 11/03 Breakthrough!! I fixed the way the shape is drawn and colored so there are no errors. I learned a lot more about P5 and how to predict what my code will actually do. I took away the background color changing based on the day of the month because a black background always looks the best in my opinion. I switched up the two color palettes to be arranged on the shape in a more artistic way. I was actually able to implement the hidden sphere at 11:11 which was a huge accomplishment. I added a riddle, and also created a secret webpage when you click on the sphere. :)

##### Things that could still be improved.. For some reason you have to right-click the sphere to open the hidden link on the sphere. Its strange, because on my smartphone you are able to tap the sphere and navigate to the page just fine.
