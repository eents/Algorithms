## *Folders in this repo are organized by week number. All the assignments for a given week can be found in the associated folder. My progress on assignments are documented below, and the most recent week will be at the top!*

### Week 04
This week I aced my quiz and got to get started on a free choice assignment! Details about what I chose are in a README in the Week04 folder.

### Week 03
I understand big O notation much better than I did last week, thanks to my breakout group and our in-class assignment. I feel like we did more than we had to, but that ended up being alright, it was helpful to hear my group think through the higher level problem solving. I aced the quiz, I should be in good shape for next week..

### Week 02
I need to dive deeper into the material so I can turn in this week's assignment. My comprehension of big O notation is still very low.

I just completed the first draft of the assignment.. Yikes. The examples from the article don't have any context, and its hard to Google. I'm also having trouble uploading my C# project to GitHub from my Mac *without just uploading the zip*. Looks like I have some studying to do..

### Week 01
This was just a setup week. No progress to report!
