## :rainbow: Big O Notation Assignment :rainbow:

### This was a gateway assignment into understanding how Algorithms are measured. I struggled to understand Big O Notation at first, but got a much better understanding after the in-class assignment that followed this one. Now I understand how choosing the correct algorithm for a given problem/data set can improve performance significantly!
